      <td class="td3">Special shader livecoding competition using <a href="https://github.com/TheNuSan/Bonzomatic">Bonzomatic</a>. Everyone starts coding at the same time from a new instance of Bonzomatic (the default tunnel). No copy pasting allowed. Live voting will be open from the start. We will be cycling through each contestants view for a fixed amount of seconds (to be determined depending on number of contestants), this will allow people to livevote on everyone and change their vote throughout the competition. After 15 minutes we will remove from the competition the lowest voted contestant. We will repeat the cycle, taking a look at every active contestant's viewport once more to allow voters to update their livevoting and then repeat the elimination process until there is only 1 contestant left.<br /><br />
	      Participation is open to everyone interested in testing their shader livecoding skills, please register yourself before October 1st by contacting psenough#2969 through discord.<br />
